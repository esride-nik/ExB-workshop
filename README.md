# Experience Builder Workshop Extensions Repo
### by [Niklas KÃ¶hn](https://github.com/esride-nik), Esri Deutschland

Some Widgets and a theme.

## How to use the samples
Clone the sample repo into your Experience Builder Client root folder and restart your watcher.

## Looking for the what3words widget?
This one was moved to its own repo: [w3w-arcgis-exb-widget](https://github.com/EsriDE/w3w-arcgis-exb-widget)

## Deprecation of NPM package "xlsx"

This package is based on the Excel tool library "SheetJS" and is no longer maintained.
The GiHub advisory db says: "[All versions of SheetJS CE through 0.19.2 are vulnerable to "Prototype Pollution" when reading specially crafted files. Workflows that do not read arbitrary files (for example, exporting data to spreadsheet files) are unaffected.](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-4r6h-8v6p-xvw6)" As we're not reading anything, I guess it's not that urgent..
.. but maybe try out [Mr.Excel](https://www.npmjs.com/package/mr-excel) some day?

## Cannot find ArcGIS Maps SDK for Javascript modules in Experience Builder >= 1.12

The patch as suggested [here](https://community.esri.com/t5/arcgis-experience-builder-questions/cannot-find-arcgis-maps-sdk-for-javascript-module/m-p/1308587#M7620) does not work for me. I need to remove the ``include`` array from tsconfig.json (no whitelist means including everyting).

Additionally, in ExB 1.12, the TypeScript definition file is missing. [Download from here](https://github.com/Esri/jsapi-resources/tree/main/typescript/archive), place in ``client/types`` and rename to ``arcgis-js-api.d.ts``.

## Polyfills for Node APIs in Experience Builder >= 1.8

Webpack 5 no longer includes polyfills for node core modules. This manifests in the error message ``BREAKING CHANGE: webpack < 5 used to include polyfills for node.js core modules by default``, meaning: Packages that use node.js core modules no longer work natively with webpack 5.

For more information on this topic, here is a good explanation: "[Webpack 4 automatically polyfilled many node APIs in the browser. This was not a great system, because it could lead to surprisingly giant libraries getting pulled into your app by accident, and it gave you no control over the exact versions of the polyfills you were using. So Webpack 5 removed this functionality.](https://gist.github.com/ef4/d2cf5672a93cf241fd47c020b9b3066a)"

There are many descriptions for the workaround, directly in the error messages in the console and also under the above mentioned source: The required sources have to be entered in ``webpack.config`` under ``resolve.fallback`` and installed via ``npm i``.

So far so good. Except that this configuration has been chopped up in ArcGIS Experience Builder and spread over several files:

![Webpack config files in ExB](./assets/webpack_configs.png)

### From left to right:
* ``webpack.config.js`` in the ``client`` root folder referencing ``webpack-extensions.config.js`` in the ``webpack`` subfolder.
* ``webpack-extensions.config.js`` builds the config from references to ``webpack-extensions.common.js``
* ``webpack-extensions.common.js`` references the actual polyfills in ``webpack.common.js``.

### Steps to do:
* In ``webpack-extensions.common.js``, add a ``fallback`` property to the ``resolve`` object in 3 places: ``getTemplatesWebpackConfig()``, ``getWidgetsWebpackConfig()`` and ``getThemesWebpackConfig()``:
    ```
    resolve: {
        alias: webpackCommon.moduleAlias,
        extensions: webpackCommon.extensions,
        mainFields: webpackCommon.resolveMainFields,
        fallback: webpackCommon.fallback
    },
    ```
* In ``webpack.common.js``, add the references to the polyfilled packages under ``exports.fallback``, e.g.:
    ```
    exports.fallback = {
        "os": require.resolve("os-browserify/browser"),
        "util": require.resolve("util/"),
        "http": require.resolve("stream-http"),
        "url": require.resolve("url/"),
        "stream": require.resolve("stream-browserify"),
        "https": require.resolve("https-browserify"),
        "zlib": require.resolve("browserify-zlib"),
        "assert": require.resolve("assert/"),
        "buffer": require.resolve("buffer/"),
    }
    ```
* ToDo: Install all referenced NPM packages on ``client`` level, e.g.:
    ```
    npm i os-browserify
    npm i util
    npm i stream-http
    npm i stream-browserify
    npm i https-browserify
    npm i browserify-zlib
    npm i buffer
    npm i assert
    npm i url
    ```

That works.

The trouble is, that the webpack files on root level of the "client" folder are not part of the "exb-web-extension-repo", but are delivered with ExB. Now if you use NPM packages in your custom widgets that require polyfills, you have to update the webpack configs on Node JS root level. Please refer to the ``_webpack5-config-updates`` subfolder in this repository for sample files.
