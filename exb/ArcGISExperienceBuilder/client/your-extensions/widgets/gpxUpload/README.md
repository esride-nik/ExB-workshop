# GPX Upload Widget

This widget provides an upload functionality for GPX files (via "react-dropzone") and converts line features into a Graphic, puts it on the map and adds a buffer, which can then be used for further activities, e.g. a spatial query against a feature layer with data. XMP parsing is done by "@tmcw/togeojson", the GeoJSON is manually transformed into Esri JSON.

## How to use the sample
