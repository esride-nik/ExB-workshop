# Excel Export

This widget exports selected records from an attribute table to an Excel file and also queries related tables from the layer. 
Derived from the Esri ["Show Record ID"](https://github.com/Esri/arcgis-experience-builder-sdk-resources/tree/master/widgets/show-record-id) sample widget.

### How to use the sample
Clone the sample repo into your Experience Builder Client root folder and restart your watcher.

### How it works
The widget defines a data action that needs to be enabled on a table widget, configured in your app. This data action transmits data from the table into the Excel Export widget for further processing.
