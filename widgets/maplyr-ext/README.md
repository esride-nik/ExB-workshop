# Map Layers Extended

This widget is derived from the original ``map-layers`` widget of ``ExB v1.13``. If building the widget is possible needs to be checked for every new version of ExB. In some cases, not all sources have been included, hence the widget couldn't be built.

This widget adds a custom action into the layer list. Tests in ``ExB v.15`` showed, that it still adds the custom action, but then runs into an error, which has NOT been fixed.

## CUSTOM EXTENSION

Custom code has been marked with the comment ``CUSTOM EXTENSION``. This has just been an build test. No functionality added yet.

Here's a list that might be incomplete:
* actions/layerfx.ts
* adding the LayerFx action in widget.tsx
