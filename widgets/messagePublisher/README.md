### How it works
This widget executes a trigger and is capable to connect it to message actions implemented by other widgets. Components:
* register ``publishMessages`` in ``manifest.json``: https://developers.arcgis.com/experience-builder/api-reference/jimu-core/WidgetManifest/#publishMessages
* implement ``"DATA_RECORDS_SELECTION_CHANGE"`` message in ``widget.tsx``: 
  ```
    MessageManager.getInstance().publishMessage(
        new DataRecordsSelectionChangeMessage(widgetId, records)
    )
  ```
* implement ``"DATA_RECORD_SET_CHANGE"`` message in ``widget.tsx``: 
  ```
    MessageManager.getInstance().publishMessage(
        new DataRecordSetChangeMessage(widgetId, RecordSetChangeType.CreateUpdate, data)
    )
  ```
